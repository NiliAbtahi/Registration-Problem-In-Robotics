Let $ \{ a_i \}_{i=1}^{N} $ and  $\{ A_i \}_{i=1}^{N} $ be sets of three dimensional position vectors of $N$ points in
two coordinate systems $S_a$ and $S_A$ , respectively, that are related to each other by an unknown element $g$ of $SE(3)$, special Euclidean group. The aim is solve
the least square problem $A_i \approx g. a_i$ for $i = 1, · · · , N$ . In this work the problem is
formulated mathematically and the Matlab code is provided.
