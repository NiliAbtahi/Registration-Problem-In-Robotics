# Registration-Problem-In-Robotics

The aim is, in this algorithm, to find Euclidean transformation between two coordinate systems for given position vectors of some points in the one system and their correspondence in the other. The formalism is based on a least square problem that is explaned in full detail in the documentation PDF file in the docs folder. 

Also a Matlab code is provided for implemting the algorithm.
