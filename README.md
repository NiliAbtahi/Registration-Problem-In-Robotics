# Registration-Problem-In-Robotics

The aim is, in this algorithm, to find Euclidean transformation between two coordinate systems for given position vectors of some points in the one system and their correspondence in the other. The formalism is based on a least square problem that is explaned in full detail in the documentation PDF file in the docs folder. 

Also a Matlab code is provided for implemting the algorithm.  The main.m file drives the program by taking two arrays of 3D position vectors in the two coordinate systems and then calling the function data_registration in the m-file with the same name. Some smaples for input data are provided in the test-data folder.
